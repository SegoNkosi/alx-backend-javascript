README FOR 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation


INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECT


1. Create a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.

Each object should have three attributes: id (Number), firstName (String), and location (String).

The array contains the following students in order:

Guillaume, id: 1, in San Francisco
James, id: 2, in Columbia
Serena, id: 5, in San Francisco

2. Create a function getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of object.

This function is taking one argument which is an array of objects - and this array is the same format as getListStudents from the previous task.

If the argument is not an array, the function is returning an empty array.

You must use the map function on the array.

3. Create a function getStudentsByLocation that returns an array of objects who are located in a specific city.

It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents) and a city (string) as parameters.

You must use the filter function on the array.

4. Create a function getStudentIdsSum that returns the sum of all the student ids.

It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents) as a parameter.

You must use the reduce function on the array.

5. Create a function updateStudentGradeByCity that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grade

It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents), a city (String), and newGrades (Array of “grade” objects) as parameters.

newGrades is an array of objects with this format:

6. Create a function named createInt8TypedArray that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position.

It should accept three arguments: length (Number), position (Number), and value (Number).

If adding the value is not possible the error Position outside range should be thrown.

7. Create a function named setFromArray that returns a Set from an array.

It accepts an argument (Array, of any kind of element).

8. Create a function named hasValuesFromArray that returns a boolean if all the elements in the array exist within the set.

It accepts two arguments: a set (Set) and an array (Array).

9. Create a function named cleanSet that returns a string of all the set values that start with a specific string (startString).

It accepts two arguments: a set (Set) and a startString (String).

When a value starts with startString you only append the rest of the string. The string contains all the values of the set separated by -.

10. Create a function named groceriesList that returns a map of groceries with the following items (name, quantity):

11. Create a function named updateUniqueItems that returns an updated map for all items with initial quantity at 1.

It should accept a map as an argument. The map it accepts for argument is similar to the map you create in the previous task.

For each entry of the map where the quantity is 1, update the quantity to 100. If updating the quantity is not possible (argument is not a map) the error Cannot process should be thrown.

12. Export a const instance of WeakMap and name it weakMap.

Export a new function named queryAPI. It should accept an endpoint argument like so:
